6. **Please select Euro Truck Simulator 2 / American Truck Simulator directory** step.

The following installation steps will vary depending on your choice on previous step. If you've chosen both games, the installer will ask you for the game directory for both games, first of which will be American Truck Simulator. Otherwise, there will be only one game.<br/>
Select the game directory by clicking **Browse...** and locating it in Steam files or copy-pasting a path directly.

The most common game directory paths are:
- for Euro Truck Simulator 2: 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2` 
- for American Truck Simulator: 
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\American Truck Simulator`

The `Euro Truck Simulator 2` and/or `American Truck Simulator` folders from `Documents` folder are not the one required here! 

> If you need assistance on how to find the game directory, proceed with the **[How to find the game folder](#How-to-find-the-game-folder)** section, then come back here.
> 
> The directory folder might already be populated. If you're not 100% sure if this is a right folder, proceed with the **[How to find the game folder](#How-to-find-the-game-folder)** section, then come back here.

# Common issues during installation process

## I don't have ATS/ETS2, but it asks for the game directory
You haven't disabled the game in step 5. Close the installer and launch it again. Pay attention to Step 5 from the **[Installation](#Installation)** section.

## "You must select valid (game) Path" error
Please proceed with the **[How to find the game folder](#How-to-find-the-game-folder)** section on how to obtain a correct game folder path.
