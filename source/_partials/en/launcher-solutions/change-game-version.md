5. Click on Betas tab on the left.

6. In "Select the beta you would like to opt into" dropdown choose the desired beta version. For most of the time, it should be set to **None**. If SCS Software updated their game and TruckersMP do not support this version yet, you will have to select a `temporary_X_XX` version. In order to know what exact version to select, ask in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/307433337126125568/307485773991510017) channel of TruckersMP official Discord or consult the [official Knowledge Base article](https://truckersmp.com/kb/26). _The chances are that people who sent you a link to this article already mentioned the version you need to select._
