1. Launch TruckersMP launcher you've downloaded earlier. Follow the installation process as usual. On **"Please select your Euro Truck Simulator 2** (or **American Truck Simulator**) **directory"** step, clear the input field, then paste the path you have copied on previous step (Right-click -> Paste or `Ctrl+V` on keyboard). You will see the path populated in the input field.
