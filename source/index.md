## A word from the creator
Hello, my name is [CJMAXiK](https://cjmaxik.ru). I am playing TruckersMP since the moment it appeared. I was actually [volunteering in TruckersMP for 6.5 years](https://truckersmp.com/user/3861/) in various positions, including Web Developer. This KB exists because I am not satisfied with how TruckersMP manages its Knowledge Base articles - they are often stale, incomplete or incorrect.

This does not mean TruckersMP Staff doesn't do a good job though :) Please make sure to thank TruckersMP Team for their efforts!
